      "### Project Vision\n",
      "The Patient Care Web Portal aims to empower patients by providing a user-friendly platform for managing their healthcare experience. The portal will allow patients to schedule appointments, access their medical records, receive notifications, and update their personal information—ultimately enhancing engagement and improving health outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### High-Level Goals for Each Sprint\n",
      "#### Sprint 1: User Authentication and Profile Management\n",
      "- **Goal**: Enable secure access to the portal and allow users to manage their profiles.\n",
      "- **User Stories**:\n",
      "  1. As a patient, I want to create an account so that I can access the portal.\n",
      "  2. As a patient, I want to log in securely so that my personal information is protected.\n",
      "  3. As a patient, I want to reset my password if I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account.\n",
      "  4. As a patient, I want to update my contact information in my profile, so that the healthcare provider can reach me effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sprint 2: Appointment Management\n",
      "- **Goal**: Allow patients to book, view, and cancel appointments easily.\n",
      "- **User Stories**:\n",
      "  1. As a patient, I want to view available appointment slots for my doctor, so that I can choose a convenient time.\n",
      "  2. As a patient, I want to book an appointment, so that I can secure my time with the healthcare provider.\n",
      "  3. As a patient, I want to receive a confirmation notification after booking an appointment, so that I have peace of mind.\n",
      "  4. As a patient, I want to cancel or reschedule my appointment if needed, so that I can manage my health care efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sprint 3: Medical Record Access\n",
      "- **Goal**: Provide patients with secure access to their medical records.\n",
      "- **User Stories**:\n",
      "  1. As a patient, I want to view my medical history, so that I can keep track of my health.\n",
      "  2. As a patient, I want to download my medical records, so that I can share them with other healthcare providers.\n",
      "  3. As a patient, I want to see my lab results, so that I can stay informed about my health status.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sprint 4: Notifications and Reminders\n",
      "- **Goal**: Set up notifications for appointments and important health reminders.\n",
      "- **User Stories**:\n",
      "  1. As a patient, I want to receive email or SMS reminders for my upcoming appointments, so that I do not forget them.\n",
      "  2. As a patient, I want to receive health-related notifications (e.g., vaccination reminders), so that I can stay proactive about my health.\n",
      "  3. As a patient, I want to customize my notification preferences, so that I can choose how and when I receive updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sprint 5: Feedback and Support\n",
      "- **Goal**: Enable patients to provide feedback and access support.\n",
      "- **User Stories**:\n",
      "  1. As a patient, I want to submit feedback about my healthcare experience, so that I can help improve services.\n",
      "  2. As a patient, I want to access a help and support section, so that I can find answers to common questions.\n",
      "  3. As a patient, I want to contact customer support directly through the portal if I have urgent issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prioritization Criteria\n",
      "- **Value to Patients**: Prioritize user stories that enhance patient engagement and convenience.\n",
      "- **Dependencies**: Address foundational functionalities first (e.g., user authentication) to support subsequent features.\n",
      "- **Technical Complexity**: Consider the technical feasibility and effort required to implement each story.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Collaboration and Communication\n",
      "Regularly interact with the Business Analyst to refine these user stories and ensure they are actionable for the Scrum Team. Conduct sprint planning meetings for the team to discuss the priorities and clarify requirements. Celebrate successes and gather feedback after each sprint to improve future iterations.\n",
      "\n",
      "By maintaining a clear focus on patient needs and prioritizing features that deliver value, we will build a robust Patient Care Web Portal that enhances the overall healthcare experience.\n",
