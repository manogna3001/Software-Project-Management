      "### Step 1: Gather User Stories and Estimates\n",
      "First, collaborate with the Product Owner to compile all user stories identified for the project. Each team role (Business Analyst, Designer, Developer, Tester, Technical Writer) should provide their effort estimates for the user stories. This can be done using methods such as Planning Poker or T-shirt sizing to ensure everyone has a voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Evaluate and Aggregate Effort Estimates\n",
      "Once the estimates are collected, aggregate them based on the following categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Analysis (Requirements)**\n",
      "2. **Design**\n",
      "3. **Development**\n",
      "4. **Testing**\n",
      "5. **Documentation**\n",
      "\n",
      "For each user story, summarize the estimates as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "| User Story ID | Analysis | Design | Development | Testing | Documentation | Total Effort |\n",
      "|---------------|----------|--------|-------------|---------|----------------|--------------|\n",
      "| US001         | 2 hours  | 3 hours| 5 hours     | 2 hours | 1 hour         | 13 hours     |\n",
      "| US002         | 1 hour   | 2 hours| 4 hours     | 1 hour  | 0.5 hours      | 8.5 hours    |\n",
      "| US003         | 2 hours  | 1 hour | 3 hours     | 2 hours | 1 hour         | 9 hours      |\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Organize User Stories by Priority\n",
      "Using the Product Backlog, prioritize the user stories based on their business value and impact. Collaborate with the Product Owner to assign priority levels (High, Medium, Low) to each story.\n",
